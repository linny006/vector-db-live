## 💡 What is this?

Automatically tracks and compares the vector database ecosystem by pulling live data from GitHub, package registries, and release feeds. Generates a structured, always-current comparison table covering maturity, integrations, language support, and recent activity for projects like pgvector, Qdrant, Chroma, Weaviate, and Milvus.

This list is **auto-updated every 15 minutes** by a GitHub Actions cron.
Each commit reflects a real change in the upstream data source — new items added,
expired items removed — so you can rely on what you see being current.

---

## 📋 Current Items

> ⏰ Last updated: _pending first run_
>
> Data source: `GitHub Search API`
>
> The table below is rewritten on every cron tick. Star the repo to bookmark.

<!-- TRACKER_TABLE_START -->
_The first cron run will populate this section._
<!-- TRACKER_TABLE_END -->

## 🔍 How it works

Every 15 minutes, a GitHub Action runs `tracker.py`. That script:

1. Fetches the latest state from `GitHub Search API`.
2. Diffs against `data/items.json` (the previous snapshot).
3. Rewrites the table above between the `<!-- TRACKER_TABLE_* -->` markers.
4. Commits `feat: +N added, -M removed (timestamp)` if anything changed.

No external services. No paid APIs. Just a public data source and a free GitHub Action.

## 🤝 Contributing

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` — usually you don't need to: the tracker keeps itself current.
If you spot a data-source bug or want to suggest a new column for the table, open
an issue.
